<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
This module needs the Python library pysftp, otherwise it cannot be installed and used. Install pysftp through the command <code>sudo pip install pysftp</code>

<h3>Version 8.0 or master?</h3>
Version 8.0 is the stable version for this module, it is tested and works without any problems.
The master version is still in testing and contains the newest features, which might still have problems/error.
If you need to connect to a remote FTP server on another port than port 22 you should download and install the master version. Version 8 does not (yet) support another port than 22.
