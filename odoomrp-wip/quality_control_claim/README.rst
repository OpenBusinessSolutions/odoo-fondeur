Quality control claim
=====================

If the quality test status is 'Quality failed', a claim is automatically
generated, to accomplish this, we have defined the field 'Automatic Claims',
in "test", and "inspection" objects.

It also defined the field "Automatic Claims by line", when this fiels is
checked, and the test line state is "No ok",a claim is automatically generated
per line.
