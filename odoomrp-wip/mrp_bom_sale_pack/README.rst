Mrp Bom Sale Pack
=================

This module allows to show on sales orders the list of components for products
with bill of materials of type 'set'.
On sale order line it shows you a compute field who shows the virtual stock of
the component with less stock.
This module create a new menu on Sales to configurate 'Set' type BoM.


Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* If there are a 'normal' BoM and a 'phantom' BoM it will take the oldest one,
  so that although there can be seen the components in the sale order line the
  picking won't have them.
