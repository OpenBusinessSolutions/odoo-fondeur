Tolerances in quality control questions
=======================================

This module adds tolerances for test questions to be marked on each inspection
line depending the introduced value, getting following tolerance status values:

* Not tolerable.
* Tolerable.
* Optimal.

For quantitative questions, two tolerance values are added, both on measure
value or percentage: tolerance below allowed interval and tolerance above
allowed interval.

For qualitative questions, for each possible answer a selection for its
tolerance status is added.

These values don't allow to make a successful inspection, but let the quality
supervisor decides if are appropiate enough for approving manually it.
