    'description': """
This module restricts making purchase orders if you don't register an
homologation record. This record can be filled with:

* Supplier and product, so the purchase is allowed for that supplier and the
  concrete product.
* Supplier and product category, so the authorization extends to all the
  products of the category or its child categories for that supplier.
* Only product or product category, allowing to purchase the product or
  products within category for any supplier.
* Start and end date that restrict the homologation to that interval of time.

You can also set the permission "Bypass purchase homologation" to certain users
to not restrict the creation of the purchase order, but only warn about the
lack of the homologation.
