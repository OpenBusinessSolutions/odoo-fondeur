Sale order allowed product template
===================================

This module adds a restriction in sale orders that has the mark "Use only
allowed products" checked for allowing to select only the product templates
that have this customer added in the customer tab of the products.

This can be done thanks to *product_supplierinfo_for_customer module*, that
allows to set customers for each product.

The restriction can be set by default for each partner, and it's propagated
to their sale orders, but it can be change for each order if you want.
