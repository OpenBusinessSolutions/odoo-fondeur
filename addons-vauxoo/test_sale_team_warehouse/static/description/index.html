   Test Sale Team Warehouse
  </h2>
  <p class="oe_mt32">
This module test the sales_team_warehouse feature.

This module will test the feature of the module sale_team_warehouse.
Should test several scenarios.
  </p>
  <p class="oe_mt32"> 
This module performs the following use cases:
  </p>
  <p class="oe_mt32">
    1.- Testing the default basic method.
    A Char type field is created in the first class, the field in
    the definition itself have a default text value, this allows to
    test that the native default_get method works as is expected.
  </p>
  <p class="oe_mt32">
    2.- Testing that the overwriting default_get works.
      In the second class the default_get method is overwritten, in
      this case proves that although the original method was modified
      can still be overridden to add additional logic.
  </p>
  <p class="oe_mt32">
    3.- Testing that the record warehouse_id match with the
    warehouse returned for the _default_warehouse method.
      In the third clase a many2one type field is added related to
      stock.warehouse model, the test proves that the required
      condition to perform the logic of the Monkey-patch over default_get
      of the sale_team_warehouse module are not set, this means that the
      user do not has a sales team.
      This test proves that the warehouse_id assigned over the record with a
      previous default its ok because match with the corresponding
      warehouse_id of the company related to the user.
  </p>
  <p class="oe_mt32">
    4.- Testing that the record warehouse_id match with the
    warehouse_id assign on the sales team of the user.
      Also for the third class is proved the Monkey-patch process
      but in this case establishing the proper conditions (in the user a
      sales tema is set and a warehouse in the sales team corresponding
      field), conditions that allow in each existing model for a field
      type many2one with relation to stock.warehouse with any default
      value configured to have by default the warehouse set on the sales
      team of the user.
