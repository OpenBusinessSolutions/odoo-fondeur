Project classification (easy hierarchy and setup for project managers)
======================================================================


This Module allows you to setup different project classification to ease the
data entry of new project. The parent project will be set as readonly to
forbid users to change it.

The parent is still available through the analytic account object.
This is useful because this way, project manager will setup correctly
the analytical account just by choosing the corresponding classification.

A project classification is composed by:

 * A name
 * An Analytic Account which represents the parent project to set
 * An optional Invoice factor
 * An optional Account Manager
 * An optional Pricelist
 * An optional Currency

Those values will be set on a project when selecting a classification.

With this module, you can easily define invoice factor, manager, ... which will be automatically set when creating a project with this classification.
No need to check which parent project, which invoicing factor, which manager.
Just by selecting a classification, you set all this fields once. 

Usage
=====

Example :
---------

Create following classification :
 * name: R-D O% administrator EUR
 * project_id: YourCompany / Internal
 * to_invoice: 0
 * user_id: Administrator
 * pricelist: Public Pricelist
 
 In project.project form view, select this 'R-D O% administrator EUR' classification.
 When selecting it, the following fields in project must have changed to be the same as the classification ones :
  * parent_id
  * to_invoice
  * user_id (Project Manager)
  * pricelist_id
  * to_invoice
  
So when you need to create a new R-D project, instead of manually filling fields, you only select a classification and it's done.
