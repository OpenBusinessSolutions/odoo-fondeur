============================
Project Task Materials Stock
============================
Project Tasks allow to record time spent, but some activities, such as
Field Service, often require you to keep a record of the materials spent.

This module extends project_task_material module to consume products spent in 
a task and create analytic lines to manage costs and create invoices.  

Configuration
=============

Check option 'Consume Material' in Task Stage to generate a stock move when
the task is in that stage.

Go to Setting -> Configuration - > Projects and enable option
"Manage time estimation on tasks"

Usage

There is a new field named "Consume Material" in "Task stage" to indicate
when you want to consume materials.
